  <p align="center">
CountryWrangler is a powerful Python library that simplifies the handling of country-related data by converting country codes, names, TLDs, phone numbers, timezones, currencies, and languages to proper ISO 3166-1 Alpha2 country codes. With CountryWrangler, you can easily standardize your data and make it consistent across your project. The library is designed for speed and efficiency, making it easy to process large datasets in no time.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
CountryWrangler is a high-performance Python library that has taken inspiration from `pycountry` and has surpassed it in terms of efficiency. With CountryWrangler, converting an Alpha3 to an Alpha2 (USA -> US) country code takes a mere 8900 nanoseconds, while the same conversion with `pycountry` on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700K CPU @ 3.80GHz takes 282.636.700 nanoseconds. 

While `pycountry` is primarily designed to serve as a database for ISO standards, CountryWrangler is specifically developed to normalize country data. Both libraries cater to their respective use cases. Additionally, CountryWrangler offers extra country functions that are designed to handle messy country data with ease.
