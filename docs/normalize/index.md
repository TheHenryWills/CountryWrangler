# Intro

When working with data related to countries, it can come in various formats and variations. Country names may be represented in short forms, official long forms, or even in different languages. Sometimes, they can be hidden within other data points like phone numbers, subdivisions, or time zones. Additionally, there are different versions of country codes, such as Alpha-2, Alpha-3, FIPS, and TLDs.

While TLDs may seem easy to handle as they are simply Alpha-2 codes, this is not always the case. For instance, the TLD for the United Kingdom is ".uk," whereas the correct ISO-3361-1 Alpha-2 code is "GB."

The normalization functions provided by CountryWrangler helps you in transforming diverse country data into their ISO-3361-1 form with ease.
